# Git Practice
<<<<<<< HEAD
[This article](https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/you-are-not-google-84912cf44afb) talks about how you shouldn't put into use some fancy technology directly, but rather should decide whether the technology is the right fit for your problem and use it only when it is.

I've never really considered this before. The last time I did need to use some sort of library from the internet, I used the first one that appeared on the search engine and was described as easy to use.

I think the article is a great reminder for me.

# Interesting Article on Software Development

I recently found [this article on the types of software development](https://www.bairesdev.com/blog/types-of-software-development-explained/) fascinating. its breaks down the various specializations within the field, such as web development, and mobile app development. 

What I find particularly interesting is how it highlights the specific skills and tools required for each type of development, showing just how diverse and dynamic the field is. This insight helps anyone looking to explore different career paths within software engineering
